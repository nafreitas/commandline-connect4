# commandline-connect4

![Screenshot](/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Example")

Program accepts 2 CLI to start.
-h signifies that a player is human controlled, and -c signifies CPU controlled

ex.
./connect4 -h -h
would run a game of a human vs another human player

The CPU player is really just a placeholder and doesn't really make contextual decisions but I would like
to implement an adequate AI at some point
